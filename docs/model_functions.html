Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility. The version displayed above was the version of the Git repository at the time these results were generated. <br><br> Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h2>Make a table of mating types and the zygotes they produce</h2>
<p>For every combination of male and female genotypes (i.e. mating types), we can calculate the types of zygotes that can be produced, as well as the relative frequency of each zygote type. It’s computationally efficient to do this before running the simulation and store all the information in a big table, and then look it up later as needed. The types of zygotes produced by each mating type depend on three parameters which are passed as arguments, namely:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>W_shredding_rate</code>, the rate at which Z* chromosomes shred susceptible W+ chromosomes in females (<span class="math inline">\(p_{shred}\)</span>)</li>
<li><code>Z_conversion_rate</code>, the rate at which Z* chromosomes convert susceptible Z+ chromosomes in males (<span class="math inline">\(p_{conv}\)</span>)</li>
<li><code>Zr_creation_rate</code>, the rate at which Z* chromosomes convert susceptible Z+ chromosomes to resistant Zr chromosomes in males, for example by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (<span class="math inline">\(p_{nhej}\)</span>)</li>

<h2>Function to add <em>de novo</em> resistance mutations</h2>
<p>This function supplements a mating_type_table with all the extra progeny classes that can appear by a mutation of one of the normal progeny classes. We assume that Z+ chromosomes can mutate to Zr and <em>vice versa</em>, and W+ to Wr and <em>vice versa</em>. We assume that mutations are equally likely in both directions, meaning that mutation will not consistently affect the allele frequencies. Also, in simulations where the <code>Zr_mutation_rate</code> and <code>Wr_mutation_rate</code> are non-zero, we set the initial frequency of Zr and/or Wr to the mutation rate (so that resistance mutations will generally already be present at the start of the burn in phase)</p>

<h2>Function to make a table of every genotype’s fitness</h2>
<p>We assume that individuals with wild type sex chromosomes (Z+ and W+), as well as non-resistant autosomal alleles (genotype aabb), have a fitness of 1. The resistant alleles (Zr, Wr, A, and B), as well as the driving Z* allele, all potentially incur costs (in the eventual paper, only the cost of Z* was actually modelled: I set all other costs to zero for brevity). These costs are multiplicative, such that the fitness cost <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> of e.g. having both Zr and A is <span class="math inline">\(c = 1 {\times} (1 - c_{Zr}) {\times} (1 - c_{A})\)</span>.

<div id="function-to-pick-the-parents-of-the-next-generation" class="section level2">
<h2>Function to pick the parents of the next generation</h2>
<p>This function is run once per generation in the simulation. It randomly picks the male and female parents of each new offspring, where parents with high fitness genotypes (e.g. Z+Z+aabb) are more likely to be picked than parents with low fitness genotypes (e.g. Z*Z*AABB). We assume a promiscuous mating system, such that individuals of both sexes potentially produce offspring with multiple partners. The fitness of each individual is stochastic, so each generation there will be some males and females that do not breed, and others that reproduce a lot.</p>
<p>We assume that all mating occurs within patches. Males thus always compete locally, meaning that alleles in males always experience “soft” selection (resulting from differences in lifetime mating success). For females, we model global and local competition separately (corresponding to hard and soft selection respectively). Selection on females results from differences in the lifetime number of offspring produced (this could be fecundity and/or viability selection).</p>
<p>We assume that under ideal conditions (e.g. in a near-empty patch or meta-population), a female with genotypic fitness <span class="math inline">\(w_j\)</span> has an expected fecundity of <span class="math inline">\(w_j * max_fecundity\)</span>, while under crowded conditions, each females’ expected fecundity tends towards <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Under soft selection, a female in a PATCH containing <span class="math inline">\(n_f\)</span> females has an expected fecundity of <span class="math inline">\(w_j * maxFecundity / (nPatches * ∑_i n_f w_i)\)</span> offspring.</p>
<p>Under hard selection, a female in a METAPOPULATION containing <span class="math inline">\(n_f\)</span> females has an expected fecundity of <span class="math inline">\(w_j * maxFecundity / (∑_i n_f w_i)\)</span> offspring.</p>
<p>The actual number of progeny per female is generated stochastically by drawing from a Poisson distribution.</p>
